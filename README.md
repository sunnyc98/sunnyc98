### Hey ğŸ‘‹ I'm Jungyoub Cha (Jay).

<p>

I'm currently an undergraduate student studying EE in <strong><a href="https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/">KAIST</a></strong>, South Korea. 
<br>I used to study semiconductors and circuits, but now my interest solely lies in <strong>AI</strong> and more recently <strong>NLP</strong>.
<br>It is still amazing to me how widely they can be applied to our society, which is one of the many reasons I switched over.
<br>I'm now committed to becoming a <strong>powerful researcher in NLP</strong>. Feel free to reach out!
